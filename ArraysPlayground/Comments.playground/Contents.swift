// Single Line Comment Syntax
/* Multi - Line Comment Syntax */

// For Single line comments it is best practice to use them as Note indicators for blocks of code before or after individual lines of code that may be ambigious to another developer.

/* For Mutli - line comments you can either type as much information as you would like in a single line of code that will jump to the next line in the compiler OR

You can press the RETURN / (ENTER) Key and continue along with comments.
Mutli - Line Comments are best used for explaining long sections of code, individual files, to take notes on acttions performed and report results, create a section of code licensing or just large blocks of example code that the user can pull out and edit without breaking the original code */
